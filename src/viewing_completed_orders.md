# Viewing Completed Orders

Completed orders can be view on the `Google Sheet` under the section `Completed Orders`, it is not recommended to load the order in the app to view it, as it offers an easy way to modify the data (which is not ideal for a completed order). Only load an order if you wish to modify it.
