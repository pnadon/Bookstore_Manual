# Making Custom Google Sheet "Sheets", Functions

`Google Sheets`, much like `Microsoft Excel`, allows you to input functions which can modify or filter the data in a spreadsheet in an easy manner. For example, one could create a new section, and then filter in orders which have been completed in the past 7 days. Please see [this link](https://support.google.com/docs/table/25273?hl=en) on a full list of functions available for `Google Sheets`.

**WARNING: DO NOT MODIFY THE DATA IN THE ORDERS SECTION. INSTEAD, CREATE A NEW SECTION AND PERFORM YOUR OPERATIONS THERE, SO THAT THE ORIGINAL DATA IS UNTOUCHED!**
