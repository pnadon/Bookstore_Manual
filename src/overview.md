## Description

`The Bookstore App` is designed to facilitate the ordering process for customers who wish to have custom text embroidered on their clothing.
To do so, the app allows one to navigate between pages, each of which offers a singular `category` of customization. Upon completing an order to their satisfaction a customer may review their order, and then the user of the app may submit the application. Upon submission, the user also has the ability to export the order summary to PDF, or begin a new order. The app also allows one to load previous order based on their order number, which easily allows the ability to correct or resume previous orders.
